        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What is carpooling?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            Carpooling is when two or more people share their commute, whether as a one-time thing or on a regular basis. People travelling from the same place to a common destination can share a ride, making things easier for both of them.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Why should I carpool? Who benefits?</h4>
          <div class="list-group-item-text">
            <p>There's a lot carpooling can do for you and the world around you. Here a just a few things on which carpooling has a positive impact:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Your wallet</strong>:
                  You can save a lot of money by carpooling. By splitting the costs between travellers in one vehicle, prices are usually lower than the price you would pay if using transit, and definitely cheaper than driving there on your own. The more passengers drivers pick up, the more the price per passenger decreases, and the more you can expect to save.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Your health</strong>:
                  The congestion and volume of traffic on the roads are a major source of stress for many drivers. Studies show that those who commute by means other than a single-occupancy vehicle demonstrate lower levels of stress, higher morale, and lower blood pressure. Trading off drivers means that each person spends less time needing to focus on the road, giving them some well-earned time to relax. Everybody wins!
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>The environment</strong>:
                  The environment is everyone's business. Using fewer cars means less air pollution and less production of greenhouse gases, which are major contributors to climate change. You can feel proud that you're helping the environment, and saving money while doing it!
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How do I find someone to carpool with?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            With CarNex, it's easy! Once you've made an account, simply log in and enter your point of origin and destination into the search bar on your dashboard. CarNex will find other people who are traveling from a small radius close to your start point, to somewhere close to your endpoint. When you find a posting you like, just contact the poster using our chat system to sort out the details.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Are users screened?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            Regrettably, we do not have the resources to individually screen users, nor would many be happy being subjected to such a process. However, each user must verify their phone numberwhen signing up, giving us a way to find them if something goes wrong, and an incentive not to let that happen. Users who have made contact with someone are able to post reviews on that person's profile for others to see, to help make their choice of who to contact. We ask that all users of the service exercise caution when meeting their fellow travellers, let friends or family know where they are travelling and with whom, and trust their instincts if something feels off.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">I am a non-smoker and I don't want to ride with smokers. Is that possible?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            This is a detail that can be worked out with fellow passengers when organizing your trip. As a matter of courtesy, users on a trip arranged through CarNex are asked not to smoke in the car without the permission of all other occupants of the vehicle.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How much should CarNex passengers pay?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            The answer to this question varies from one CarNex group to another. It depends upon negotiation, but it is definitely cheaper than driving your own car. Usually each passenger will pay an equal portion of the entire trip's cost (minus the driver's amount) to the driver.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Where and when should we meet?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            Scheduling a pick-up time and location can be determined by the driver and the passengers when arranging their trip. In the interest of getting everyone to where they need to be on time, it is a good idea to arrive at the specified location at least 5-10 minutes before the scheduled departure. For your safety, we advise you always to meet at a public location, let a friend or family member know the details of your trip, and make sure you feel safe before getting into someone else's car.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What happens if someone doesn't show up?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            Being on-time is just as important in an agreement like with CarNex as it is with transit. Each CarNex driver and passenger should have clearly-defined guidelines for how long they will wait. You should also exchange contact information with the people you will be travelling with before the trip so that you can let each other know about unexpected delays. If someone does not arrive within a reasonable amount of time, and you are unable to contact them, you can make the trip without them and choose to leave feedback on their profile to let other users know that that person may be unreliable.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What if I can't find any posts matching my criteria?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            If you can't find someone to travel with, you can easily create your own posting to find people to make a trip with you. Keep checking back; hopefully someone will respond to your post and make a post meeting your guidelines soon.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Is there a charge to use CarNex?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            No. CarNex is a free service provided by five undergraduate students at the University of Toronto who just want to help connect people with others travelling the same route to decrease road congestion and reduce stress on the environment. The website is and always will be 100% free.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Is my information private?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            We know that security is very important to you. You can be assured that we have made the best of efforts to secure our database. While online, you will be identifiable to drivers and other users only through your username and other information you choose until you're ready to share more with them. You can decide exactly what is visible on your profile to yourself, other users to the service, and people who have not logged in through your account settings panel.
