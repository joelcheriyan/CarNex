      You can navigate the site by opening the homepage at index.html. Most of the pages leave the user in the logged-out state. Clicking the sign up button will take you to the currently non-functional sign-up page; clicking the buttons on the sign-up page will allow you to progress through the steps. Clicking the log in button and entering any username and password will allow you to access the pages where an example user (Jane Doe) is logged in. You can click Jane Doe's username at the top to access her profile. Logging in will take you to the dashboard which lists recent posts. Clicking the search button on the dashboard page will take you to a sample search results page. The account settings will also be accessible from the top navigation.
